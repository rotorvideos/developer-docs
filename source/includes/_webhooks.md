# Webhooks

The Rotor API will fire webhooks to registered endpoints, per application. For example, every time an order is placed in an embeddable, and finalized, a webhook will be sent to the application's registered endpoints, that are subscribed to that event.

## Webhook Endpoints

Rotor needs to know where to send events. You can register multiple webhooks with Rotor by emailing engineering@rotorvideos.com.

You will need to provide the publicly accessible HTTPS URL to your webhook endpoint, and select the type of events youâ€™re receiving in your endpoint.

## Webhook Events

Rotor API will fire webhooks for the following events:

### Event: `order.finalized`

          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
When the renders for the order have been completed and uploaded to the cloud, Rotor marks the order as complete, and triggers `order.finalized`
